## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Compliance is now fail-closed. When `governance.compliance` is set and
  cannot be applied, `godml run` aborts with `ComplianceError`
  (`godml.compliance_service.errors`) instead of logging the error and
  training on the unprocessed data. This covers engine failures, a missing
  compliance engine and unsupported standards: a YAML with
  `compliance: gdpr` (or any value other than `pci-dss`) now fails instead of
  being silently skipped. Applies to `ComplianceEngine.apply`,
  `run_pipeline_preprocessing`, the MLflow executor and the dataprep recipe
  hook.

### Changed

- License text: the `LICENSE` file now contains the MIT license. GoDML has
  always been distributed under MIT (package metadata, README and source
  headers); the Apache-2.0 text that appeared in `LICENSE` was re-added by
  mistake and did not reflect the project's license.
- Package metadata uses the SPDX license expression `MIT` (PEP 639), and
  source headers use `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`.
